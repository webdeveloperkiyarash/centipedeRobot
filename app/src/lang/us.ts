    description: `Tinco stands for Triad Intelligence Nexus Centipede Operation;
      a multi‑part project aimed at building an intelligent, controllable, and extensible centipede robot.
      This robot is designed by combining artificial intelligence, image processing, and modern communication technologies.
      Its applications can include environmental monitoring, rescue operations, robotics education, and even scientific entertainment.
      The ultimate goal is to create a platform that is usable and expandable both for researchers and everyday users.`

    description: `⚠️ Emergency Mode: In critical situations, the robot may enter an emergency state.
🔋 Low Battery – when the power level drops dangerously, the system prioritizes safe shutdown or return.
🧭 Lost Navigation – if the robot loses its path or orientation, emergency protocols are triggered to prevent further risk.
↩️ Return Back – the robot can decide to retrace its steps to a safe location.
🤖 In all cases, the AI evaluates the context and decides which option is the most effective response.`,
